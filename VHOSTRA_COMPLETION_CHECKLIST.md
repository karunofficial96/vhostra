# Vhostra completion checklist (internal)

- [x] Verify real cwebp enablement in the active Vhostra runtime (installed `webp`; `cwebp 1.5.0` reported by CLI).
- [x] Verify repository-derived LSPHP catalog and one optional lifecycle operation against the active runtime (APCu install/enable is reported by the HTTP PHP module endpoint).

- [x] Visually validate compact, transparent service artwork in light and dark themes; replace any remaining wordmark treatment.
- [x] Validate MariaDB dark-theme contrast in the rendered Electron UI.
- [x] Create, package, and validate a transparent, padded native tray asset (packaged 1x/2x resources and native macOS alpha/bounds acceptance).
- [x] Implement complete dynamically discovered LSPHP extension catalog and lifecycle operations (repository metadata, live module state, IPC/UI actions, disable/enable verification, and persisted APCu restoration across a Vhostra runtime restart).
- [x] Integrate hosts-file mapping state, retry/repair, and owned-mapping updates into every vhost workflow.
- [x] Audit and complete equivalent Services UI, CLI, and tray operations.
- [x] Validate dedicated Quit workspace and native close-policy behavior (native keep/stop exit, minimize process survival, shared stop/failure coverage; original preference restored).
- [x] Validate configuration-path migration recovery and UI feedback (isolated live database preservation, final PHP health failure rollback, source runtime recovery, and refreshed location feedback).
- [x] Validate phpMyAdmin automatic authentication and all real database operations (isolated live create/list/import/export/check/delete and migration persistence).
- [x] Implement and validate Apache/Nginx selected-runtime behavior and rewrite support.
- [x] Implement and validate transactional candidate runtime replacement across server/PHP changes.
- [x] Validate custom-port/HTTPS conflict behavior against live host state.
- [ ] Validate startup integrations across supported platforms. Implementation and platform-contract tests passed (Linux XDG lifecycle/quoting; macOS/Windows native API verification/refusal). Full native login acceptance remains blocked by unavailable Windows/Linux environments and denied development-Mac registration.
- [x] Validate offline Help, bounded Logs, About/update neutral state, privacy, welcome page, app/tray/favicon packaging.
- [x] Complete TODO/placeholder/dummy/mock audit and final DESIGN.md visual audit (no production TODO/dummy/mock implementations; input placeholders and documented screenshot/parser/external-restore limitations are intentional).

Final validation (2026-09-27):
- Production desktop/welcome/Electron/preload build and all 21 automated tests passed.
- Native Electron preload bridge, tray representation/alpha/bounds, and eight-mark light/dark artwork harnesses passed.
- Runtime shell syntax, CLI syntax, and git diff --check passed.
- Prior isolated live runtime acceptance remains valid. Only recovery-file cleanup changed afterward; both verified rollback and failed-recovery retention have targeted fault-injection coverage.

External release acceptance:
- Native Windows/Linux login launches require those platforms; the native Mac denied development-app login registration. API contract and refusal/approval-required feedback are tested, not substitutes for platform login acceptance.
- Signed installer production and an actual release/update endpoint are not configured in this checkout. Packaged local asset/resource references are verified; no signed installer or release update was claimed.
